# Product Requirements Document: Custom Keyboard Shortcuts Chrome Extension

## Introduction/Overview

This Chrome extension enables power users and knowledge workers to create custom keyboard shortcuts for any website, allowing them to quickly perform actions like clicking buttons, focusing search fields, and navigating web applications without lifting their hands from the keyboard. The extension addresses the frustration of frequently-used websites lacking essential keyboard shortcuts, particularly for search functionality and common navigation tasks.

**Problem Statement:** Many web applications lack comprehensive keyboard shortcuts, forcing users to constantly switch between keyboard and mouse, reducing productivity and breaking workflow concentration.

**Solution:** A Chrome extension that allows users to bind custom keyboard combinations to DOM elements and actions on any website, with intelligent site-specific scoping and conflict management.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Enable users to create reliable, persistent keyboard shortcuts for clicking elements and focusing inputs on any website
2. **User Experience Goal:** Provide a simple, intuitive interface for creating and managing shortcuts without requiring technical knowledge
3. **Performance Goal:** Ensure shortcuts execute consistently with <100ms response time
4. **Scope Goal:** Support site-specific shortcut management with automatic filtering based on current domain

## User Stories

**Core User Stories:**
- As a knowledge worker, I want to press Ctrl+/ to focus the search box on any website so that I can quickly search without reaching for my mouse
- As a power user, I want to create a shortcut to click the "New Document" button in Google Docs so that I can create documents faster
- As a productivity enthusiast, I want to manage different shortcuts for different websites so that I can optimize my workflow for each tool I use
- As a user, I want my shortcuts to work consistently across browser sessions so that I can rely on them in my daily workflow

**Management Stories:**
- As a user, I want to see only shortcuts relevant to my current website so that I'm not overwhelmed by irrelevant shortcuts
- As a user, I want to edit or delete shortcuts I've created so that I can refine my workflow over time
- As a user, I want to be notified when my custom shortcut overrides a browser shortcut so that I'm aware of the conflict

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
1. **FR1.1:** The system must allow users to create keyboard shortcuts using standard modifier combinations (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meta + key)
2. **FR1.2:** The system must support "click element" action type for any clickable DOM element
3. **FR1.3:** The system must support "focus element" action type for input fields and text areas
4. **FR1.4:** The system must store shortcuts locally using Chrome's storage API
5. **FR1.5:** The system must scope shortcuts by domain (e.g., shortcuts for google.com only work on google.com)
6. **FR1.6:** The system must provide a popup interface accessible via the extension toolbar icon
7. **FR1.7:** The system must display only shortcuts relevant to the current website in the popup
8. **FR1.8:** The system must allow manual CSS selector input for targeting elements
9. **FR1.9:** The system must include one pre-loaded sample shortcut for demonstration
10. **FR1.10:** The system must provide basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for shortcuts

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX
11. **FR2.1:** The system must provide a visual element picker similar to Chrome DevTools inspector
12. **FR2.2:** The system must generate reliable CSS selectors automatically when using the visual picker
13. **FR2.3:** The system must provide a "test" button to validate selectors before saving
14. **FR2.4:** The system must show visual feedback (highlight/flash) when shortcuts execute successfully

### Phase 3: Advanced Management
15. **FR3.1:** The system must support import/export of shortcuts as JSON files
16. **FR3.2:** The system must provide search functionality across all shortcuts
17. **FR3.3:** The system must support inline editing of keyboard combinations
18. **FR3.4:** The system must provide a dedicated options page for bulk management

### Phase 4: Robust Error Handling
19. **FR4.1:** The system must retry failed actions with XPath fallback selectors
20. **FR4.2:** The system must display toast notifications for errors and conflicts
21. **FR4.3:** The system must log detailed error information to console for debugging
22. **FR4.4:** The system must warn users when creating shortcuts that conflict with essential browser shortcuts

### Phase 5: Advanced Scoping
23. **FR5.1:** The system must support path prefix matching (e.g., reddit.com/r/programming/*)
24. **FR5.2:** The system must support subdomain scoping (e.g., mail.google.com vs docs.google.com)
25. **FR5.3:** The system must implement priority-based rule matching (path > subdomain > domain)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Complex Macros:** Multi-step action sequences (reserved for v2)
- **Scroll Actions:** Scrolling to elements or positions (reserved for v2)
- **URL Navigation:** Opening new tabs or navigating to URLs (reserved for v2)
- **Cloud Sync:** Synchronizing shortcuts across devices
- **Advanced Conflict Resolution:** Sophisticated handling of shortcut conflicts beyond basic warnings
- **Mobile Support:** Extension functionality on mobile browsers
- **Content Script Injection Control:** Granular control over which sites load the extension

## Design Considerations

### Popup Interface Design
- **Size:** Compact popup (320px width, max 500px height) following Chrome extension standards
- **Layout:** Clean list view with shortcuts grouped by current site
- **Styling:** Match Chrome's native UI patterns using system fonts and standard spacing
- **Actions:** Primary "Add Shortcut" button, inline edit controls, contextual menus

### Visual Picker Design
- **Behavior:** Identical to Chrome DevTools element inspector
- **Visual Feedback:** Blue highlight outline on hover, click to select
- **Overlay:** Temporary injection with cleanup after selection

### Keyboard Shortcut Input
- **Format:** Standard key combination capture (e.g., "Ctrl+Shift+S")
- **Validation:** Real-time validation of key combinations
- **Conflicts:** Visual indication of potential browser shortcut conflicts

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Manifest Version:** Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Background Script:** Service worker for handling registered commands
- **Content Scripts:** Injected for fallback key listening and action execution
- **Storage:** Chrome storage.local API (no sync requirements for v1)

### Key Implementation Details
- **Selector Strategy:** Prefer ID > stable classes > data attributes > generated CSS paths
- **Fallback Chain:** CSS selector → XPath selector → error handling
- **Permission Model:** Dynamic host permissions requested per-origin on first use
- **Conflict Resolution:** Chrome commands API primary, content script fallback

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Shortcuts must execute within 100ms of key press
- **Memory Usage:** Minimize content script footprint
- **Startup Time:** Extension must be ready within 500ms of page load

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Reliability:** Shortcuts execute successfully >95% of the time across different websites
2. **Performance:** Average shortcut execution time <100ms
3. **User Adoption:** Users create and actively use at least 3 shortcuts within first week

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Error Rate:** <5% of shortcut executions result in errors
2. **User Retention:** Users continue using extension after 1 week of testing
3. **Support Requests:** Minimal support requests related to core functionality

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- User can successfully create a shortcut using manual CSS selector input
- User can trigger shortcuts consistently on target websites
- Shortcuts persist across browser sessions
- Basic error handling prevents extension crashes

## Open Questions

1. **Selector Reliability:** How should we handle dynamic websites where CSS selectors change frequently? Should we implement a fallback strategy using multiple selector types?
Yes, use a fallback of multiple selectors.

2. **Performance Impact:** What is the acceptable performance impact on page load times? Should we lazy-load content scripts only when shortcuts are defined for a site?
Lazy-load when shortcuts are defined for a site.

3. **User Onboarding:** Beyond the sample shortcut, do we need an interactive tutorial for Phase 1, or is the interface intuitive enough?
Nothing else is needed at this time.

4. **Browser Compatibility:** Should Phase 1 support other Chromium browsers (Edge, Brave) or focus exclusively on Chrome?
- Edge and Vivaldi need to be supported

5. **Shortcut Limits:** While we agreed on no artificial limits, should we implement soft warnings for users creating excessive shortcuts (e.g., >20 per site)?
Yes, have a warning of potential performance issues when there are more than 15 shortcuts on one site.

6. **Extension Icon States:** Should the toolbar icon reflect the number of shortcuts available on the current site or remain static?
It can reflect the number of shortcuts available on the current site
